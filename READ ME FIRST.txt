 QuickBooks integration support for PHP 5.x+ 
 
 The package you've downloaded contains code and documentation for connecting 
 various versions and editions of QuickBooks to PHP, allowing your PHP 
 applications to do fancy things like:
 
  - Automatically send orders placed on your website to QuickBooks 
  
  - Charge credit cards using the QuickBooks Merchant Service
  
  - Connect to the Intuit Partner Platform and access IDS Services  
  
  - Get access to QuickBooks reports 
  
  - Pull information out of QuickBooks and display it online 
  
  - Connect to all Microsoft Windows versions of QuickBooks
  
  - Connect to QuickBooks Online Edition
  
  - etc. etc. etc.
  
  
 Almost anything you can do in the QuickBooks GUI, in QuickBooks Online 
 Edition, and with QuickBooks Merchant Service can be accomplished via this 
 framework.
