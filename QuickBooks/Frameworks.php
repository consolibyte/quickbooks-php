 * These framework constants allow you to specify that you only want to include
 * certain sets of files that are applicable to you, instead of including
 * everything. Including everything has a performance penalty (on some machines
 * it can take 0.3 seconds to load all of the includes) so including just the
 * stuff you need can help to alleviate some performance headaches.
