// Create the new invoice object
$Invoice = new QuickBooks_QBXML_Object_Invoice();

// We need to assign this invoice to a customer. There are a few ways you can
// refer to this customer in your qbXML requests. You can refer to them by
// 	their Name/FullName, by their ListID (a primary key within QuickBooks) or,
//	if you've created a mapping between the customer's primary key within your
//	application and the customer in QuickBooks *and* you are using the
//	QuickBooks_API classes, you can refer to them by the primary key within
//	your application, and the framework will map this value to a ListID for
//	you. (For an example of this last case you should see
//	example_api_client.php and example_api_client_canadian.php)
//
$Invoice->setCustomerName('The Company & Name DerpÃ©');
// $Invoice->setCustomerListID($ListID_from_QuickBooks);

// Invoice #A-123
$Invoice->setRefNumber('A-123');

// Set some other fields...
$Invoice->setMemo('This invoice was created using the QuickBooks PHP API!');

// Now, we need to build each invoice line for the invoice. Each invoice line
//	will contain at least a reference to an item, and probably a quantity or
//	the item ordered, and either a total amount or a rate (price per item).
//
// As with customers above, the items need to be present in QuickBooks before
//	we can add an invoice that depends on them. You can again refer to the item
//	in three different ways:
//	- Name/FullName
//	- ListID
//	- a mapped primary key from your application
//
// 	For this example, we're going to refer to the items by name, so the items
//	must already be present in QuickBooks for this invoice to be added.

// 3 items of type "Item Type 1" at $10.00 per item
$InvoiceLine1 = new QuickBooks_QBXML_Object_Invoice_InvoiceLine();
$InvoiceLine1->setItemName('Item Type 1');
$InvoiceLine1->setRate(10.00);
$InvoiceLine1->setQuantity(3);

// 5 items of type "Item Type 2", for a total amount of $225.00 ($45.00 each)
$InvoiceLine2 = new QuickBooks_QBXML_Object_Invoice_InvoiceLine();
$InvoiceLine2->setItemName('Item Type 2');
$InvoiceLine2->setAmount(225.00);
$InvoiceLine2->setQuantity(5);

// Make sure you add those invoice lines on to the invoice
$Invoice->addInvoiceLine($InvoiceLine1);
$Invoice->addInvoiceLine($InvoiceLine2);

// NOTE: These next few lines *only work for QuickBooks Online Edition*

// Let's add a discount also
//$DiscountLine = new QuickBooks_QBXML_Object_Invoice_DiscountLine();
//$DiscountLine->setAmount(-125.0);
//$Invoice->addDiscountLine($DiscountLine);

// And a shipping charge
//$ShippingLine = new QuickBooks_QBXML_Object_Invoice_ShippingLine();
//$ShippingLine->setAmount(5.0);
//$Invoice->addShippingLine($ShippingLine);

// Convert that object to qbXML
//
// It is important to note that the ->asQBXML method *does not* currently take
//	into account field length limits or data types from the qbXML
//	specification, you'll need to do that yourself. Support for this may be
//	added in the future. For now, you can use the QuickBooks_Cast::cast()
//	method to cast values to the correct type and length before setting them
//	in the object.
//
// $value = 'Keith Palmer';
// $xpath = 'Name';
// // Makes sure the $value will fit in a QuickBooks Customer Name field
// $Name = QuickBooks_Cast::cast(QUICKBOOKS_OBJECT_CUSTOMER, $xpath, $value);
//
// $value = '56 Cowles Road';
// $xpath = 'ShipAddress/Addr1';
// Makes sure the $value will fit in a QuickBooks Customer ShipAddress/Addr1 field
// $ShipAddress_Addr1 = QuickBooks_Cast::cast(QUICKBOOKS_OBJECT_CUSTOMER, $xpath, $value);

$qbxml = $Invoice->asQBXML(QUICKBOOKS_ADD_INVOICE);
print($qbxml);

// Prints the following XML:
/*
