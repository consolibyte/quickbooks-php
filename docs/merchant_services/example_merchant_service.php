// There are two methods of attaching an application to QuickBooks Merchant
//	Services. Intuit provides a 'Hosted' model, and a 'Desktop' model. The
//	'Hosted' model provides additional security benefits and is designed for
//	web applications, while the 'Desktop' model is easier to set up and
//	designed for desktop applications.
//
// Either the 'Hosted' or the 'Desktop' model can be used if you're developing
//	a web application.
//
// If you're using the 'Hosted' model, you'll need to provide the full path to
//	the key/certificate you/Intuit generates here. Otherwise, you can pass a
//	null. This file should have the private key you generated concatenated to
//	the beginning of the file. So the file contents should look something like:
//
//	-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
//	... bla bla bla lots of stuff here ...
//	-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
//	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
//	... bla bla bla lots of stuff here ...
//	-----END CERTIFICATE-----

//	documentation about how to set up your certificate here:

/*
There are several methods available in the QuickBooks_MerchantService class.
The most common methods are described below:

 - authorize()
    This authorizes a given amount against the a credit card. It is important
    to note that this *does not* actually charge the credit card, it just
    "reserves" the amount on the credit card and guarentees that if you do a
    capture() on the same credit card within X days, the funds will be
    available.

    Authorizations are used in situations where you want to ensure the money
    will be availble, but not actually charge the card yet. For instance, if
    you have an online shopping cart, you should authorize() the credit card
    when the customer checks out. However, because you might not have the item
    in stock, or there might be other problems with the order, you don't want
    to actually charge the card yet. Once the order is all ready to ship and
    you've made sure there's no problems with it, you should issue a capture()
   	using the returned transaction information from the authorize() to actually
   	charge the credit card.

 - capture()

 - charge()

 - void()

 - refund()

 - voidOrRefund()

 - openBatch()

 - closeBatch()
