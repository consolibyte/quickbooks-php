Very simple example Drupal 7 module for QuickBooks integration

This is a very simple Drupal 7 example module which integrates with
QuickBooks. The module creates a Customer in QuickBooks for every User in
Drupal.

IMPORTANT:
	The module assumes that you have the QuickBooks PHP DevKit in a folder in
	your root Drupal directory. If you want to put it somewhere else, change
	the require_once path below.

Please note that this is NOT meant for use out-of-the-box. It's meant as an
example, on top of which you can build your own Drupal and QuickBooks
integration. To be a really robust Drupal module, it would at the very least
need some cleanup so that things are configurable within Drupal, etc.
