QuickBooks PHP DevKit
=====================

QuickBooks integration support for PHP 5.x+

The package you've downloaded contains code and documentation for connecting various versions and editions of QuickBooks to PHP, allowing your PHP applications to do fancy things like:

- Automatically send orders placed on your website to QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks for Windows
- Charge credit cards using Intuit Payments / QuickBooks Merchant Services
- Connect to QuickBooks v3 APIs via OAuth
- Get access to QuickBooks reports
- Pull information out of QuickBooks and display it online
- Connect to all Microsoft Windows versions of QuickBooks
- Connect to all QuickBooks Online versions
- Authenticate via OAuth
- etc. etc. etc.

Almost anything you can do in the QuickBooks GUI, in QuickBooks Online Edition, and with QuickBooks Merchant Service can be accomplished via this framework.

## Support

### Questions/general support 

**Before you ask for help** make sure you: 

- If you're connecting to QuickBooks Online, run the `troubleshooting.php` script: <https://github.com/consolibyte/quickbooks-php/blob/master/docs/partner_platform/example_app_ipp_v3/troubleshooting.php>
- Make sure you post your code - we can't help without seeing what you're doing.

**Now** that you have the output of the `troubleshooting.php` script and your code together, ask in one of these two places:
